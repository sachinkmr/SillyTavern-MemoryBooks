## 🙈 Token Saving: Hide / Unhide Messages

One of the easiest ways to reduce clutter and save tokens in long chats is to hide messages after you have already turned them into memories.

### What does “hide” mean?

Hiding messages does **not** delete them. It only hides them from the AI. Your chat messages are still there, and your memories still remain in the lorebook, so the important information is not lost; it's just not sent directly to the AI.

### Why would I use this?

Hide/unhide is helpful when:
- your chat has become very long
- you already made memories for those messages

### Auto-hide after memory creation

STMB can automatically hide messages after a memory is created. You can choose:

- **Do not auto-hide**: leaves everything visible (you can hide messages manually with `/hide x-y`)
- **Auto-hide all messages up to the last memory**: hides everything already covered by memory creation
- **Auto-hide only messages in the last memory**: hides just the most recent processed range

You can also choose how many recent messages stay visible with **Messages to leave unhidden**.

### Unhide before memory generation

The setting **Unhide hidden messages for memory generation** tells STMB to temporarily run `/unhide X-Y` for the selected range before generating the memory. Use this if you tend to re-do memories. 

### Good beginner setup

Aiko's settings:
- use **Auto-hide messages up to the last memory**
- leave **2 messages unhidden**
- turn on **Unhide hidden messages for memory generation**

## 🌈 Summary Consolidation

Summary Consolidation helps keep long stories manageable by compressing older STMB memories into higher-level recap entries.

### Q: What is Summary Consolidation?

**A:** Instead of only creating scene-level memories forever, STMB can combine existing memories or summaries into a more compact recap. The first tier is **Arc**, and higher recap tiers are also available for longer stories:

- Arc
- Chapter
- Book
- Legend
- Series
- Epic

### Q: Why use it?

**A:** Consolidation is useful when:

- Your memory list is getting long
- Older entries no longer need full scene-by-scene detail
- You want to reduce token usage without losing continuity
- You want cleaner, higher-level narrative recaps

### Q: Does it run automatically?

**A:** No. Consolidation still requires confirmation.

- You can always open **Consolidate Memories** manually from the main popup
- You can also enable **Prompt for consolidation when a tier is ready**
- When a selected target tier reaches its saved minimum eligible count, STMB shows a **yes/later** confirmation
- Choosing **Yes** opens the consolidation popup with that tier selected; it does not silently run by itself

### Q: How do I use it?

**A:** To create a consolidated summary:

1. Click **Consolidate Memories** in the main STMB popup
2. Choose the target summary tier
3. Pick the source entries you want included
4. Optionally disable the source entries after the new summary is created
5. Click **Run**

For previews of these entries, enable "show previews" in your preferences.

## 🎨 Trackers, Side Prompts, & Templates (Advanced Feature)

**Side Prompts** are background trackers that help maintain ongoing story information. They run alongside memory creation and update separate side-prompt lorebook entries over time. Think of them as **helpers that watch your story and keep certain details up to date**.

### 🚀 **Quick Start with Templates**

1. Open Memory Books settings
2. Click **Side Prompts**
3. Browse the **template library** and choose what fits your story:

   * **Character Development Tracker** – Tracks personality changes and growth
   * **Relationship Dynamics** – Tracks relationships between characters
   * **Plot Thread Tracker** – Tracks ongoing storylines
   * **Mood & Atmosphere** – Tracks emotional tone
   * **World Building Notes** – Tracks setting details and lore
4. Enable the templates you want (you can customize them later)
5. If the template uses automatic triggers, STMB will keep that side-prompt entry updated alongside memory creation

[Scribe showing step by step process to enable automatic side prompts](https://scribehow.com/viewer/How_to_Enable_Side_Prompts_in_Memory_Books__fif494uSSjCmxE2ZCmRGxQ)

### ⚙️ **How Side Prompts Work**

* **Background Trackers**: They run quietly and update information over time
* **Non-Intrusive**: They do not change your main AI settings or character prompts
* **Per-Chat Control**: Different chats can use different trackers
* **Template-Based**: Use built-in templates or create your own
* **Automatic or Manual**: Standard templates can run automatically; templates with custom runtime macros are manual-only
* **Macro Support**: `Prompt`, `Response Format`, `Title`, and keyword fields can expand standard ST macros like `{{user}}` and `{{char}}`
* **Runtime Macros**: Non-standard `{{...}}` tokens become required command inputs such as `{{npc name}}="Jane Doe"`
* **Plain Text Allowed**: Side prompts do not have to return JSON
* **Overwrite Behavior**: Side prompts update their own tracked entry over time instead of creating a new sequential memory every run

### 🛠️ **Managing Side Prompts**

* **Side Prompts Manager**: Create, edit, duplicate, and organize trackers
* **Enable / Disable**: Turn trackers on or off at any time
* **Import / Export**: Share templates or back them up
* **Status View**: See which trackers are active in the current chat and when they run
* **Safety Checks**: If a template contains custom runtime macros, STMB strips automatic triggers on save/import and shows a warning toast

### 💡 **Template Examples**

* Side Prompt Template Library (import this JSON):
  [SidePromptTemplateLibrary.json](/resources/SidePromptTemplateLibrary.json)

Example prompt ideas:

* “Track important dialogue and character interactions”
* “Keep the current quest status up to date”
* “Note new world-building details when they appear”
* “Track the relationship between Character A and Character B”

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Per-Character Mode**

Per-character mode runs a **separate LLM call for each character** in the chat and writes the result to each character's own lorebook. This is ideal for trackers that maintain character-specific state like relationship assessments, character knowledge, or personality tracking.

**How to enable:**

1. Open the **Side Prompts Manager**
2. Click **Edit** on a side prompt (or create a new one)
3. Check **"Per-character mode"** at the bottom of the dialog
4. Save

**What happens when it runs:**

- STMB discovers all characters in the chat (all group members, or the single character)
- For each character, it runs the template with `{{charname}}` resolved to that character's name
- Each character gets a separate lorebook entry titled `[Template] [CharName] (STMB SidePrompt)`
- The character's name is automatically added to entry keywords
- Entries are written to **each character's own lorebook** (the lorebook attached to the character card via `character.data.extensions.world`)
- If a character has no lorebook, STMB prompts you to select an existing one or create a new one. This choice is saved permanently in extension settings — you'll only be asked once per character.

**Using `{{charname}}` in prompts:**

When per-character mode is enabled, `{{charname}}` is automatically available in the prompt, response format, and entry title fields. Use it to make the LLM write from a specific character's perspective:

```
Assess the interaction between {{charname}} and {{user}} to date.
List all the information {{charname}} has learned about {{user}}.
```

> **Note:** `{{char}}` resolves to the card's primary character (as always in SillyTavern). `{{charname}}` resolves to whichever character is currently being processed in the per-character loop. In single chats they are the same; in group chats they differ.

**Ready-to-use template:** A comprehensive per-character context tracker template with emotional scoring, character growth tracking, and relationship milestones is available at [`resources/context-tracker-template.md`](resources/context-tracker-template.md).

**Managing Character Lorebook Mappings:**

At the bottom of the **Trackers & Side Prompts** dialog, expand **Character Lorebook Mappings** to see which lorebook each character is mapped to. From here you can:
- **Change** a character's lorebook by selecting a different one from the dropdown
- **Remove** a mapping by clicking the ✕ button (STMB will ask again next time you run a per-character template for that character)

These mappings are created automatically the first time you run a per-character side prompt for a character without an attached lorebook. They persist across sessions in extension settings.

---

### 📚 **Override Write Lorebook(s) per Side Prompt**

By default, every side prompt writes its entry into the same lorebook that is bound to the current chat. You can override this on a **per-side-prompt basis** to send the output to one or more different lorebooks instead.

**When would you use this?**
- Separate your trackers from your memories (e.g., plot threads go into a dedicated "Plot" lorebook while chat memories stay in the main one)
- Mirror the same tracker entry into multiple lorebooks at once
- Keep a shared world-state lorebook that is updated by side prompts across different chats

**How to set it up:**

1. Open the **Side Prompts Manager**
2. Click **Edit** on any side prompt (or create a new one)
3. Scroll down to the **Overrides** section at the bottom of the dialog
4. Check **"Override write lorebook(s) for this side prompt"**
5. A scrollable list of all your lorebooks will appear — check **one or more** to receive the output
6. Click **Save**

**What happens:**
- If one or more lorebooks are selected, the side prompt writes its result there **instead of** the default chat-bound lorebook
- If you select multiple lorebooks, every selected lorebook receives the **same output** (the entry title and content are duplicated into each)
- If a selected lorebook has been deleted or renamed, the side prompt will fall back to the default lorebook and log a warning — nothing breaks
- When the override is **disabled** or no lorebooks are checked, the side prompt behaves exactly as before using the chat-bound default

> **Tip:** The default (chat-bound) lorebook is never written to when an override is active with at least one valid target. If you want the output in *both* the default and an additional lorebook, add the default lorebook to the checked list as well.

### 🔧 **Creating Custom Side Prompts**

1. Open Side Prompts Manager
2. Click **Create New**
3. Write a short, clear instruction
   *(example: “Always note what the weather is like in each scene”)*
4. Optionally add standard ST macros like `{{user}}` or `{{char}}`
5. If you add custom runtime macros like `{{location name}}`, run it manually with `/sideprompt "Name" {{location name}}="value"`
6. Save and enable it
7. The tracker will now update this information over time if it uses automatic triggers; otherwise run it manually when needed

### 💬 **Pro Tip**

Side Prompts work best when they are **small and focused**.
Instead of “track everything,” try “track romantic tension between the main characters.”

### ⌨️ **Manual /sideprompt Syntax**

Use:
`/sideprompt "Name" {{macro}}="value" [X-Y] [-debug]`

Examples:
- `/sideprompt "Status" 10-20`
- `/sideprompt "NPC Directory" {{npc name}}="Jane Doe" 40-50`
- `/sideprompt "Context Tracker" -debug`
- `/sideprompt "Location Notes" {{place name}}="Black Harbor" 100-120`

Notes:

- The side prompt name must be quoted.
- Runtime macro values must be quoted.
- Slash-command autocomplete will suggest required runtime macros after you choose the side prompt.
- If a template contains custom runtime macros, STMB keeps it manual-only and strips automatic triggers.
- `X-Y` is optional. If you omit it, STMB uses messages since the last time that side prompt was updated.
- If you run side prompts manually and separately, remember to turn on `unhide before generation`!
- Add `-debug` to dump detailed logs to the browser console (F12). Logs include: template resolution, per-character iteration, full LLM prompts/responses, upsert params, and lorebook write confirmations. Look for orange `[STMB-DEBUG]` entries.

### 🧠 Advanced Text Control with the Regex Extension

**Want ultimate control over the text STMB sends to and receives from the AI?** STMB can run selected Regex scripts before generation and before saving.

This is useful when you want to:
- Clean repetitive junk out of AI responses
- Normalize names or terminology before generation
- Reformat text before STMB parses or previews it

#### **How It Works Now**

1. Create any scripts you want in SillyTavern's **Regex** extension
2. In STMB, turn on **Use regex (advanced)**
3. Click **📐 Configure regex…**
4. Choose which scripts STMB should run:
   - before sending text to the AI
   - before adding the response to the lorebook

#### **Important Behavior**

- Regex selection for STMB is controlled inside **STMB**, not by the script's enabled/disabled state in the Regex extension
- A script selected in STMB can still run even if it is disabled in the Regex extension itself
- STMB supports multi-select for both outgoing and incoming processing

#### **Quick Example**

If your model keeps adding `(OOC: I hope this summary is helpful!)`, you can:

1. Create a Regex script that removes that text
2. Turn on **Use regex (advanced)** in STMB
3. Open **📐 Configure regex…**
4. Add that script to the **incoming** selection

Now STMB will clean the response before previewing or saving it.

## ⚙️ Settings That Matter First

This guide is not the full settings reference. For the complete setting-by-setting list, use [readme.md](readme.md).

The controls most users should learn first are:
- **Current SillyTavern Settings**: uses your active ST connection directly without creating a custom provider profile
- **Create your own STMB Profile**: lets you customize STMB eg. use a different/cheaper model for memories vs roleplay
- **Auto-hide/unhide memories**: the token savings that you make memories for!
- **Manual Lorebook Mode** and **Auto-create lorebook if none exists**: control where memories are stored
- **Show memory previews**: lets you review or edit AI output before saving
- **Auto-create memory summaries**: turns automatic memory generation on
- **Auto-Summary Interval** and **Auto-Summary Buffer**: control when automatic memory generation runs
- **Side Prompts**: enables trackers

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting (When Things Don't Work)

This guide is not the full troubleshooting matrix. For the detailed list, use [readme.md](readme.md).

The fastest first checks are:

- Make sure STMB is enabled and the **Memory Books** menu item appears under the extensions wand
- If auto-summary is not firing, verify that you created one manual memory first and that your interval/buffer settings are reasonable
- If memories cannot be saved, make sure a lorebook is bound to the chat or that **Auto-create lorebook if none exists** is enabled
- If memories aren't triggering, make sure "delay until recursion" is disabled.
- If regex behavior seems wrong, check the selections inside **📐 Configure regex…** rather than only checking the Regex extension
- If consolidation is not prompting, confirm that **Prompt for consolidation when a tier is ready** is enabled and that the target tier is included in **Auto-Consolidation Tiers**
