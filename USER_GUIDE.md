## 🌈 Arc Summaries

Arc Summaries are created manually. Nothing is summarized or removed unless you choose to do it.

### Q: What are Arc Summaries?

**A:** Arc Summaries help keep long stories manageable. Over time, you may collect many old memory entries. Some of them describe the same part of the story.
An Arc Summary lets you combine several older memories into one shorter summary.

### Q: What happens when I make an Arc Summary?

**A:** When you create an Arc Summary:

* The selected memories are combined into one new entry
* The new summary replaces those older memories
  *(older memories can be hidden automatically — not deleted)*
* The story is still remembered, but with fewer tokens

### Q: Why make Arc Summaries?

**A:** Arc Summaries are useful when:

* Your memory list is getting very long
* Older memories are no longer needed in full detail
* You want to reduce token usage in long chats

### Q: How do I make an Arc Summary?

**A:** To create an Arc Summary:

1. Click **🌈 Consolidate Memories into Arcs** at the bottom of the main STMB popup.
2. Choose an arc type:

   * **Multi-Arc**
     The AI looks for natural breaks and creates multiple arcs.
     You can set a minimum number of memories per arc.
     *Works best with strong models (GPT, Gemini, Sonnet). Local models may struggle.*
   * **Single Arc**
     The AI combines all selected memories into one arc.
     Previous arcs are included to help keep the story consistent.
   * **Tiny**
     A faster, simpler option that may work better with local models,
     but results may be less detailed.
3. Select the memories you want to include.
4. Click **Run** and wait for the arc analysis to finish.

## 🎨 Trackers, Side Prompts, & Templates (Advanced Feature)

**Side Prompts** are background trackers that help maintain ongoing story information.
They run alongside memory creation and can update the same notes over time. Think of them as **helpers that watch your story and keep certain details up to date**.

### 🚀 **Quick Start with Templates**

1. Open Memory Books settings
2. Click **Side Prompts**
3. Browse the **template library** and choose what fits your story:

   * **Character Development Tracker** – Tracks personality changes and growth
   * **Relationship Dynamics** – Tracks relationships between characters
   * **Plot Thread Tracker** – Tracks ongoing storylines
   * **Mood & Atmosphere** – Tracks emotional tone
   * **World Building Notes** – Tracks setting details and lore
4. Enable the templates you want (you can customize them later)
5. Your memories will now include this tracking automatically

[Scribe showing step by step process to enable automatic side prompts](https://scribehow.com/viewer/How_to_Enable_Side_Prompts_in_Memory_Books__fif494uSSjCmxE2ZCmRGxQ)

### ⚙️ **How Side Prompts Work**

* **Background Trackers**: They run quietly and update information over time
* **Non-Intrusive**: They do not change your main AI settings or character prompts
* **Per-Chat Control**: Different chats can use different trackers
* **Template-Based**: Use built-in templates or create your own
* **Automatic or Manual**: Some run automatically, others can be run by command

This makes the trigger behavior understandable without technical terms.

### 🛠️ **Managing Side Prompts**

* **Side Prompts Manager**: Create, edit, duplicate, and organize trackers
* **Enable / Disable**: Turn trackers on or off at any time
* **Import / Export**: Share templates or back them up
* **Status View**: See which trackers are active in the current chat and when they run

### 💡 **Template Examples**

* Side Prompt Template Library (import this JSON):
  [SidePromptTemplateLibrary.json](/resources/SidePromptTemplateLibrary.json)

Example prompt ideas:

* “Track important dialogue and character interactions”
* “Keep the current quest status up to date”
* “Note new world-building details when they appear”
* “Track the relationship between Character A and Character B”

### 📚 **Override Write Lorebook(s) per Side Prompt**

By default, every side prompt writes its entry into the same lorebook that is bound to the current chat. You can override this on a **per-side-prompt basis** to send the output to one or more different lorebooks instead.

**When would you use this?**
- Separate your trackers from your memories (e.g., plot threads go into a dedicated "Plot" lorebook while chat memories stay in the main one)
- Mirror the same tracker entry into multiple lorebooks at once
- Keep a shared world-state lorebook that is updated by side prompts across different chats

**How to set it up:**

1. Open the **Side Prompts Manager**
2. Click **Edit** on any side prompt (or create a new one)
3. Scroll down to the **Overrides** section at the bottom of the dialog
4. Check **"Override write lorebook(s) for this side prompt"**
5. A scrollable list of all your lorebooks will appear — check **one or more** to receive the output
6. Click **Save**

**What happens:**
- If one or more lorebooks are selected, the side prompt writes its result there **instead of** the default chat-bound lorebook
- If you select multiple lorebooks, every selected lorebook receives the **same output** (the entry title and content are duplicated into each)
- If a selected lorebook has been deleted or renamed, the side prompt will fall back to the default lorebook and log a warning — nothing breaks
- When the override is **disabled** or no lorebooks are checked, the side prompt behaves exactly as before using the chat-bound default

> **Tip:** The default (chat-bound) lorebook is never written to when an override is active with at least one valid target. If you want the output in *both* the default and an additional lorebook, add the default lorebook to the checked list as well.

---

### 🔧 **Creating Custom Side Prompts**

1. Open Side Prompts Manager
2. Click **Create New**
3. Write a short, clear instruction
   *(example: “Always note what the weather is like in each scene”)*
4. Save and enable it
5. The tracker will now update this information over time

### 💬 **Pro Tip**

Side Prompts work best when they are **small and focused**.
Instead of “track everything,” try “track romantic tension between the main characters.”

### 🧠 Advanced Text Control with the Regex Extension

**Want ultimate control over the text that gets sent to and received from the AI?** ST Memory Books now seamlessly integrates with the official **Regex** extension, allowing you to automatically transform text using custom rules.

**Multi-Select Support:** You can now multi-select regex scripts in the Regex extension. All enabled scripts will be applied in order at each stage (Prompt and Response), allowing for powerful and flexible transformations.

This is an advanced feature perfect for users who want to:
- Automatically clean up repetitive phrases or artifacts from an AI's response.
- Reformat parts of the chat transcript before the AI sees it.
- Standardize terminology or character mannerisms on the fly.

#### **How It Works: Two Simple Hooks**

The integration works by applying your enabled regex scripts at two critical points. You control which scripts run by setting their **Placement** in the Regex extension's editor:

1.  **Modifying the Prompt (Outgoing Text)**
    *   **Placement to use**: `User Input`
    *   **What it does**: Intercepts the fully assembled prompt (including chat history, system instructions, etc.) right before it's sent to the AI for memory or side prompt generation.
    *   **Example Use Case**: You could create a script to automatically replace all instances of a character's nickname with their full name, ensuring the AI has the proper context.

2.  **Modifying the Response (Incoming Text)**
    *   **Placement to use**: `AI Output`
    *   **What it does**: Intercepts the raw text response from the AI *before* it gets parsed or saved as a memory.
    *   **Example Use Case**: If your AI model often includes repetitive phrases like *"As a large language model..."* in its summaries, you can create a regex script to automatically remove this phrase from every memory it generates.

#### **Quick Start Example: Cleaning AI Responses**

Let's say your AI model consistently adds `(OOC: I hope this summary is helpful!)` to its memory generations. Here’s how to automatically remove it:

1.  **Go to the Regex Extension**: Open the main SillyTavern extensions menu and go to **Regex**.
2.  **Create a New Script**: Click "Open Regex Editor" to create a new regex script.
3.  **Configure the Script**:
    *   **Script Name**: `Clean OOC Notes`
    *   **Find Regex**: `/\\(OOC:.*?\\)/g` (This finds the text "(OOC: ...)" and everything inside it).
    *   **Replace String**: Leave this blank to delete the matched text.
    *   **Affects (Placement)**: Uncheck all boxes except for **AI Output**. This is the most important step!
    *   **Enable the Script**: Make sure the script is not disabled.
4.  **Save and You're Done!**

Now, every time ST Memory Books gets a response from the AI, this script will run automatically, cleaning the unwanted text before the memory is saved to your lorebook.

## ⚙️ Settings That Actually Matter

Don't worry - you don't need to configure everything! Here are the settings that make the biggest difference:

### 🎛️ **Auto-Summary Frequency**
- **20-30 messages**: Great for detailed, slower chats
- **40-60 messages**: Perfect for faster, action-packed conversations  
- **80+ messages**: For very fast group chats or casual conversations

### 📝 **Memory Previews** 
- Turn this ON to review memories before they're saved
- You can edit, approve, or regenerate if the AI missed something important
- Recommended for important storylines

### 🏷️ **Memory Titles**
- Customize how your memories are named
- Use `{{title}}` for AI-generated titles, `{{scene}}` for message numbers
- Example: `"Chapter [000] {{title}} ({{scene}})"` becomes `"Chapter 001 The Great Escape (Scene 45-67)"`

### 📚 **Memory Books** (Lorebooks)
- **Auto mode**: Uses your chat's default memory lorebook (easiest)
- **Manual mode**: Pick a specific lorebook for each chat (for organization)
- **Auto-create**: Makes new lorebooks automatically (good for new characters)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting (When Things Don't Work)

### "I don't see the Memory Books option!"
- Check that the extension is installed and enabled
- Look for the magic wand (🪄) icon next to your chat input
- Try refreshing the page

### "The arrow buttons (► ◄) aren't showing up!"
- Wait 3-5 seconds after loading a chat - they need time to appear
- If still missing, refresh the page
- Make sure ST Memory Books is enabled in extensions
- Ensure you are running the latest version of SillyTavern

### "Auto Summary isn't working!"
- Double-check that "Auto-Summary" is enabled in Memory Books settings.
- Make sure you have primed the chat by creating one memory manually!
- Has the message interval been reached? Auto-summary waits for enough new messages.
- If you postponed auto-summary, it might be waiting until a certain message count.
- Auto-summary only processes new messages since the *last* memory. If you deleted old memories, it doesn't go back.

### "I get errors about missing lorebooks!"
- Go to Memory Books settings
- Either bind a lorebook to your chat (Automatic Mode or Manual Mode) or enable "Auto-create lorebook if none exists"

### "Sometimes it fails for no reason!"
- Make sure that your Max Response Length (in SillyTavern's Chat Completion Presets) are set at a large enough number. Aiko recommends a minimum of 2000 tokens (Aiko runs 4000.)
- Again... this is _Chat Completion_. You will need to make the change while ST's connection says "Chat Completion" (you can switch back after you're done).
- The error messages are more detailed now, but if you are still having problems please contact Aiko on Github or Discord.

### "My custom prompts aren't working right!"
- Check the "Summary Prompt Manager" in Memory Books settings
- Ensure your prompt instructs the AI to respond in **JSON format** (e.g., `{ "title": "...", "content": "..." }`)
- The JSON format has to have these three objects: `title`, `content`, and `keywords`.
